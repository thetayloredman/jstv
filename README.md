# jstv -- JavaScript STV Implementation

JSTV is a Node.js implementation of [Single Transferrable Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) using random selections for transfers.

Debugging output is enabled by setting `DEBUG` as an environment variable, to any value like `DEBUG="stv stv:*"`.

This package is seriously work-in-progress.
